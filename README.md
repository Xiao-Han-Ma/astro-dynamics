Astro-Dynamics Command CenterAn interactive, high-fidelity web-based simulation engine designed to visualize planetary kinematics, celestial geometric configurations, and advanced astronomical phenomena from a geocentric perspective.🌌 OverviewThe Astro-Dynamics Command Center is a specialized tool developed to bridge the gap between abstract orbital mechanics and visual observation. By leveraging heliocentric-to-geocentric coordinate transformations, the application provides an authentic representation of how planets move across the Earth's sky, including the complex "figure-8" retrograde loops and the photometric nuances of astronomical transits.🚀 Key Features1. Dynamic Orbital ModelingReal-time Simulation: Visualizes the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.Physics-Based Proportions: Planetary orbital radii and angular velocities are scaled to reflect relative solar system dynamics.2. Celestial Geometric ConfigurationsDemonstrates critical positional astronomy concepts with precise academic definitions:Inferior Planets: Visualizes Inferior/Superior Conjunctions and Greatest Elongations (Morning/Evening Star phases).Superior Planets: Explores Conjunction, Opposition (closest approach and full illumination), and Quadrature (90° alignment).3. Dual-HUD Retrograde TrackingA sophisticated observation module that tracks planetary "backward" motion using two synchronized perspectives:Ecliptic Azimuth View: Maps the apparent ecliptic longitude ($\lambda$) on a 360° circular projection.Sky Trajectory (Figure-8): A 3D-to-2D projection mapping Longitude ($\lambda$) vs. Latitude ($\beta$). By incorporating orbital inclination ($i$), the simulator reveals the authentic loop and S-shape patterns seen in professional ephemeris data.4. Advanced Transit AnalyticsSimulates the rare event of a planet crossing the solar disk with high-precision photometry:Solar Disk Observation: A high-resolution view of the transit ingress and egress.Smart Time Dilation: The simulation automatically decelerates when a transit occurs, allowing for detailed observation of the contact phases.Luminosity Flux Analysis: Real-time generation of a Light Curve. The occlusion model uses a non-linear smoothstep function to represent the gradual dip in solar brightness as the planetary disk occults the star.🛠 Technical ImplementationCoordinate TransformationThe simulator calculates the 3D position of planets in a heliocentric frame before translating them to a geocentric observer:Geocentric Vector: $\vec{D} = \vec{P}_{planet} - \vec{P}_{earth}$Apparent Longitude ($\lambda$): $\operatorname{atan2}(D_y, D_x)$Apparent Latitude ($\beta$): $\operatorname{atan2}(D_z, \sqrt{D_x^2 + D_y^2})$Photometric ModelingThe transit light curve is not a simple step function. It models the fractional flux $(\Delta F/F)$ based on the overlapping area of the solar and planetary disks, providing a smooth transition during the ingress and egress stages.📖 How to UseMaster Reset: Use the MASTER_RESET button to return all planets to their initial epoch and real-time motion.Category Selection: Choose between Inferior or Superior planets to unlock specific geometric configurations.Tracking: Click Retrograde Motion and select a target (e.g., Mars) to activate the Dual-HUD tracking system.Transit: Activate the Transit Watch to observe Venus crossing the Sun and monitor the resulting light curve in the analytics window.🌐 DeploymentThis project is designed to be hosted via GitHub Pages.Push index.html to a public repository.Enable GitHub Pages in Settings > Pages.Access the live simulation at https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]/.✍️ AuthorXiaohan MaSpace Physics Researcher | Data Science EnthusiastWould you like me to add a "Mathematical Appendix" to this README to explicitly document the Smoothstep flux equations for your portfolio?
